# Shop-Easy

## Crux of the application
* Shop Easy detects the user's location and sends a notification according to the retail shop he is at.
* The notification redirects to a registration page specific to the shop he/ she is visiting, upon clicking the notification.
* The user goes through a quick registration process and he/ she is exposed to a bunch of offers give by the shop he/ she is at.
* A unique code is also generated which when used at checkout, can reduce the interaction between the cashier adn the customer.

This repo contains only the android, notification part, and not the registration process.
