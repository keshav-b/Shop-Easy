# Shop-Easy

## Crux of the application
* Shop Easy detects the user's location and sends a notification according to the retail shop he is at.
* The notification redirects to a registration page specific to the shop he/ she is visiting, upon clicking the notification.
* The user goes through a quick registration process and he/ she is exposed to a bunch of offers give by the shop he/ she is at.
* A unique code is also generated which when used at checkout, can reduce the interaction between the cashier adn the customer.
